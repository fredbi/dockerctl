## dockerctl image ImageGetAll

Get a tarball containing all images and metadata for several image repositories.

For each value of the `names` parameter: if it is a specific name and tag (e.g. `ubuntu:latest`), then only that image (and its parents) are returned; if it is an image ID, similarly only that image (and its parents) are returned and there would be no names referenced in the 'repositories' file for this image ID.

For details on the format, see [the export image endpoint](#operation/ImageGet).
