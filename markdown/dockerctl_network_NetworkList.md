## dockerctl network NetworkList

Returns a list of networks. For details on the format, see [the network inspect endpoint](#operation/NetworkInspect).

Note that it uses a different, smaller representation of a network than inspecting a single network. For example,
the list of containers attached to the network is not propagated in API versions 1.28 and up.


```
dockerctl network NetworkList [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --filters map[string][]string   JSON encoded value of the filters (a map[string][]string) to process on the networks list. Available filters:
                                      
                                      - `dangling=<boolean>` When set to `true` (or `1`), returns all
                                         networks that are not in use by a container. When set to `false`
                                         (or `0`), only networks that are in use by one or more
                                         containers are returned.
                                      - `driver=<driver-name>` Matches a network's driver.
                                      - `id=<network-id>` Matches all or part of a network ID.
                                      - `label=<key>` or `label=<key>=<value>` of a network label.
                                      - `name=<network-name>` Matches all or part of a network name.
                                      - `scope=["swarm"|"global"|"local"]` Filters networks by scope (`swarm`, `global`, or `local`).
                                      - `type=["custom"|"builtin"]` Filters networks by type. The `custom` keyword returns all user-defined networks.
                                      
  -h, --help                          help for NetworkList
```
