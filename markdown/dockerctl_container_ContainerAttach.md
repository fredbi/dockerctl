## dockerctl container ContainerAttach

Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach to the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers that have been detached.

Either the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint to do anything.

See [the documentation for the `docker attach` command](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach/) for more details.

### Hijacking

This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` on the same socket.

This is the response from the daemon for an attach request:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream

[STREAM]
```

After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

To hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Docker client can also optionally send connection upgrade headers.

For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

```
POST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1
Upgrade: tcp
Connection: Upgrade
```

The Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will similarly follow with the raw stream:

```
HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
Content-Type: application/vnd.docker.raw-stream
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: tcp

[STREAM]
```

### Stream format

When the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each containing a header and a payload.

The header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or `stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in the last four bytes (`uint32`).

It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:

```go
header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}
```

`STREAM_TYPE` can be:

- 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)
- 1: `stdout`
- 2: `stderr`

`SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size encoded as big endian.

Following the header is the payload, which is the specified number of bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.

The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:

1. Read 8 bytes.
2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.
3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.
4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.
5. Goto 1.

### Stream format when using a TTY

When the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's `stdin`.


```
dockerctl container ContainerAttach [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --detachKeys [a-Z]   Override the key sequence for detaching a container.Format is a single character [a-Z] or `ctrl-<value>` where `<value>` is one of: `a-z`, `@`, `^`, `[`, `,` or `_`.
  -h, --help               help for ContainerAttach
      --id string          Required. ID or name of the container
      --logs stream        Replay previous logs from the container.
                           
                           This is useful for attaching to a container that has started and you want to output everything since the container started.
                           
                           If stream is also enabled, once all the previous output has been returned, it will seamlessly transition into streaming current output.
                           
      --stderr stderr      Attach to stderr
      --stdin stdin        Attach to stdin
      --stdout stdout      Attach to stdout
      --stream             Stream attached streams from the time the request was made onwards
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --base-path string   For example: /v1.41 (default "/v1.41")
      --config string      config file path
      --debug              output debug logs
      --dry-run            do not send the request to server
      --hostname string    hostname of the service (default "localhost")
      --scheme string      Choose from: [http https] (default "http")
```
