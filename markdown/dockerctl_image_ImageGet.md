## dockerctl image ImageGet

Get a tarball containing all images and metadata for a repository.

If `name` is a specific name and tag (e.g. `ubuntu:latest`), then only that image (and its parents) are returned. If `name` is an image ID, similarly only that image (and its parents) are returned, but with the exclusion of the `repositories` file in the tarball, as there were no image names referenced.

### Image tarball format

An image tarball contains one directory per image layer (named using its long ID), each containing these files:

- `VERSION`: currently `1.0` - the file format version
- `json`: detailed layer information, similar to `docker inspect layer_id`
- `layer.tar`: A tarfile containing the filesystem changes in this layer

The `layer.tar` file contains `aufs` style `.wh..wh.aufs` files and directories for storing attribute changes and deletions.

If the tarball defines a repository, the tarball should also include a `repositories` file at the root that contains a list of repository and tag names mapped to layer IDs.

```json

  "hello-world": {
    "latest": "565a9d68a73f6706862bfe8409a7f659776d4d60a8d096eb4a3cbce6999cc2a1"
  }
}
