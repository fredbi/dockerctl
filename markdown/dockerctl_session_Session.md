## dockerctl session Session

Start a new interactive session with a server. Session allows server to call back to the client for advanced capabilities.

### Hijacking

This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to HTTP2 transport that allows the client to expose gPRC services on that connection.

For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

```
POST /session HTTP/1.1
Upgrade: h2c
Connection: Upgrade
```

The Docker daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response follow with the raw stream:

```
HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: h2c
```


```
dockerctl session Session [flags]
```
